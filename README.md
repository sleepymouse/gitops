# A Practical Demonstration of Developing Against a Kubernetes Environment

This project was developed as a side project to something else I was building (The Panopticon - the main project on this GitHub site).
I found that setting up a production-like environment was considerably more difficult than it initially appeared from the relevant documentation.

After going through considerable effort to get an environment working, I decided to document it, as having a fully constructed working example
is amazingly useful when trying to attempt something. Hopefully others who tread this path after me will find this guide useful. 

Consider this a glorified Hello World!

## 1. What I wanted

A highly automated environment where I could commit code as a developer, which would then go through the build / test / deploy cycle with minimal intervention into
a production-like environment

This environment needed to have the following characteristics

1. Everything built as Docker containers and deployed into a Kubernetes environment
2. Complete automation from the point of the git commit
3. Full observability stack
4. Running a local environment that mimicked a real-world, cloud-based environment as closely as possible

## 2. The Parts

The project is split into three distinct areas:

1. Getting Kubernetes up and running, with associated tooling — see [install-kubernetes.md](install-kubernetes.md)
2. Deployment of an observability environment in Kubernetes — see [install-observability.md](install-observability.md)
3. Deployment of the application services

## 3. Technology

| [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) | Log storage, LogQL queries, Kubernetes log aggregation |
| [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) | Distributed trace storage, trace search, service dependency analysis |
| [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) | Dashboards, alerting, metrics/logs/traces exploration; data sources for Mimir, Loki, Tempo |
| [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) | Deployment status, replica counts, pod state, job state, HPA metrics |
| [prometheus-node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) | CPU, memory, disk, network metrics |
| [Alloy](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/) | OTLP ingestion, log collection, metric scraping, forwarding to Mimir, Loki and Tempo |
